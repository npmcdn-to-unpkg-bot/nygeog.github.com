#Geospatial Analysis and Cartography in the Age of Web Mapping


One thing I've noticed emerging in **GIS/Geospatial** mapping technology is basic geospatial analysis that tends to oversimplify or over-generalize complex spatial problems. 

Many geographers and geography/GIS students should have taken some basic **site suitability**, **spatial analysis** or **environmental modeling** courses. 

While I took several courses discussing spatial analysis and modeling, I think University at Buffalo's **GEO470/570 (Law 777) Integrated Environmental Management** best prepared me for actually modeling and thinking more consideratly about environmental modeling .

There is no question that web mapping companies and technology have propelled **GIS** and **geospatial analysis** into the public sphere, thought it is important to recognize, "[with that power comes great responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Ben)." Part of the role of the **geographer or GIS analyst** is to reduce a problem to measurable spatial components. However, if the problem can be


In this age of click-bait, retweeting, reposting, TL;DR (too long, didn't read) and a lessening of journalistic due diligence, its important that when we publish a map, we do so with responsibilyt and an explanation of **methods** the **limitations**. That way the **map reader** comes to

#WE SHOULDN"T BE PUBLISHING THEMATIC SPATIAL ANLAYSIS MAPS WITH THE INTENTION OF THE MAP GOING VIRAL, WE AS GIS ANLYSITS AND DATA SCIENTISTS OWE IT TO OURSELVES AND TO THE PUBLIC TO DISPLAY QUANTITATIVE SPATIAL INFORMATION IN WAY THAT INFORMS, NOT MISLEADS




One of my favrote examples of doing better GIS and doing do diligence in GIS anlaysis is [Mapping NYC stop and frisks: some cartographic observations](http://spatialityblog.com/2012/07/27/nyc-stop-frisk-cartographic-observations/) DESPITE THE CONTRAVERSALITY AND CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE SUBJECT, WWHAT STEVE OUTLINES IS somewhat the principles and ethics of cartography and those of the cartographer
