I haven't posted in a while as I've started working for [CARTO](https://carto.com/) in late June. It has been a great opportunity to work with one of the most innovative mapping and locational data companies. I was only a CartoDB employee for a week before we dropped the 'DB.' 

Anyway, I have been super interested in [Car2Go](https://www.car2go.com/US/en/) ever since it came to Brooklyn. My partner Kim is in Seattle and I've been out there quite a bit and find it very useful there.
